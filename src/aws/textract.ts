To get the results of the invoice/receipt analysis operation, first ensure that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetExpenseAnalysis, and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartExpenseAnalysis. Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of blocks that are returned.

To get the next page of results, call GetExpenseAnalysis, and populate the NextToken request parameter with the token value that's returned from the previous call to GetExpenseAnalysis.
