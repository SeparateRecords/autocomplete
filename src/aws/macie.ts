            "Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. Similarly, if provided ``yaml-input`` it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with ``--cli-input-yaml``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards compatibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated",
