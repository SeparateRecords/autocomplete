    "Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Audit Manager API operations, data types, and errors.  Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection so that you can continually audit your Amazon Web Services usage. You can use it to assess the effectiveness of your controls, manage risk, and simplify compliance. Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate assessments for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a prebuilt collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are grouped according to the requirements of the specified compliance standard or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls to support internal audits with specific requirements.  Use the following links to get started with the Audit Manager API:    Actions: An alphabetical list of all Audit Manager API operations.    Data types: An alphabetical list of all Audit Manager data types.    Common parameters: Parameters that all Query operations can use.    Common errors: Client and server errors that all operations can return.   If you're new to Audit Manager, we recommend that you review the  Audit Manager User Guide",

Recipients have 120 days to accept or decline the request. If no action is taken, the share request expires. When you create a share request, Audit Manager stores a snapshot of your custom framework in the US East (N. Virginia) Amazon Web Services Region. Audit Manager also stores a backup of the same snapshot in the US West (Oregon) Amazon Web Services Region. Audit Manager deletes the snapshot and the backup snapshot when one of the following events occurs:   The sender revokes the share request.   The recipient declines the share request.   The recipient encounters an error and doesn't successfully accept the share request.   The share request expires before the recipient responds to the request.   When a sender resends a share request, the snapshot is replaced with an updated version that corresponds with the latest version of the custom framework.  When a recipient accepts a share request, the snapshot is replicated into their Amazon Web Services account under the Amazon Web Services Region that was specified in the share request.   When you invoke the StartAssessmentFrameworkShare API, you are about to share a custom framework with another Amazon Web Services account. You may not share a custom framework that is derived from a standard framework if the standard framework is designated as not eligible for sharing by Amazon Web Services, unless you have obtained permission to do so from the owner of the standard framework. To learn more about which standard frameworks are eligible for sharing, see Framework sharing eligibility in the Audit Manager User Guide",
