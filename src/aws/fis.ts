Actions: The actions to carry out on the target. You can specify multiple actions, the duration of each action, and when to start each action during an experiment.    Stop conditions: If a stop condition is triggered while an experiment is running, the experiment is automatically stopped. You can define a stop condition as a CloudWatch alarm.
