Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling  A transaction is a single GetRecommendations or GetPersonalizedRanking call. Transactions per second (TPS) is the throughput and unit of billing for Amazon Personalize. The minimum provisioned TPS (minProvisionedTPS) specifies the baseline throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize, and thus, the minimum billing charge.   If your TPS increases beyond minProvisionedTPS, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below minProvisionedTPS. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions. The actual TPS used is calculated as the average requests/second within a 5-minute window. You pay for maximum of either the minimum provisioned TPS or the actual TPS. We recommend starting with a low minProvisionedTPS, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary.  Status  A campaign can be in one of the following states:   CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED   DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS   To get the campaign status, call DescribeCampaign.

You create recommenders for a Domain dataset group and specify the recommender's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) when you make a GetRecommendations request.   Minimum recommendation requests per second  When you create a recommender, you can configure the recommender's minimum recommendation requests per second. The minimum recommendation requests per second (minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond) specifies the baseline recommendation request throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize. The default minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond is 1. A recommendation request is a single GetRecommendations operation. Request throughput is measured in requests per second and Amazon Personalize uses your requests per second to derive your requests per hour and the price of your recommender usage.   If your requests per second increases beyond minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of requests.  Your bill is the greater of either the minimum requests per hour (based on minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond) or the actual number of requests. The actual request throughput used is calculated as the average requests/second within a one-hour window. We recommend starting with the default minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond as necessary.
